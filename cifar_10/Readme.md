# CIFAR-10 image classification on Pi-Zero <br>
he CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. he images are very small (32x32) and by visualizing them you will notice how difficult it is to distinguish them even for a human.

In this notebook we are going to build a CNN model that can classify images of various objects. We have 10 class of images:

    Airplane
    Automobile
    Bird
    Cat
    Deer
    Dog
    Frog
    Horse
    Ship
    Truck
