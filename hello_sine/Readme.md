# Prediction of Sine wave using TFLITE MICRO on Pi-Zero

Model is trained on Google Colab (available in .ipynb Jupyter notebook) and converted into TFLITE format. The converted model is used to run inference on Pi-Zero. <br>
Run ***python hello_sine_tflite.py*** from parent directory in shell to run the inference on Pi Zero.
